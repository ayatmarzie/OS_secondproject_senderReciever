# OS_secondproject_senderReciever
The second project is similar to producer-consumer problem. we have a limited buffer and consumers
and producers. The producers generate random strings and write them into empty slots, if there arenâ€™t
any, they will be blocked until an empty slot exists. The consumers should read these slots and write
them on a shared memory between consumers. There is a consumers handler which reads this shared
memory and show it as an output. Consumers will be blocked if all slots are empty. Multi-thread,
semaphore, conditional variables is used in this project. The programming language is C++ and as far
as it was a university project no QT version of semaphores or other features is used.
